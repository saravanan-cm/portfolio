Hello! I'm Saravanan, an energetic Lead software engineer with almost 5 years of startup experience in handling cross-functional teams and building scalable SaaS products from scratch. An enthusiastic team player and a deep creative thinker from a fast-paced startup environment.

I'm one of the core developers who can build major/critical features of the product. Parallelly expertise in handling multiple teams at the same time. Always there has been a relationship with me and Integrations from [Zarget](https://www.freshworks.com/marketing-automation/?source=fworks&medium=referral&campaign=fworks_product_nav) itself.

Now handling a cross-functional Expense management team and the integrations team simultaneously in [Itilite](https://www.itilite.com/home).
