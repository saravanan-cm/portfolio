Hello! I'm Saravanan, an energetic senior software engineer with 3.5+ years of experience in developing robust code. An enthusiastic team player and a deep creative thinker from a fast-paced startup environment.

Always, I like to add more attractive and cool features in our products. In my free time, I regularly explore the new product releases in Product Hunt to get more new ideas and I do read startup news frequently using Inshorts.

Basically I'm one of the core developers team who develops major/critical features of the product. Parallelly managing the Integrations team on my own. Always there has been a relationship with me and Integrations from [Zarget](https://www.freshworks.com/marketing-automation/?source=fworks&medium=referral&campaign=fworks_product_nav) itself. Also built major skills and trained Maya (an AI voice assistant) in my previous company named [Smartron](https://smartron.com/tronx.html). Being the Best performer for the last 3 years and got multiple awards for it.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
