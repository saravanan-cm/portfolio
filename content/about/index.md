Hello! I'm Saravanan, an energetic Technical Lead with 6+ years of startup experience in handling cross-functional teams and building scalable SaaS products from scratch. An enthusiastic team player and a deep creative thinker from a fast-paced startup environment.

Always, I like to build reliable, scalable systems with high concurrency. I do follow Product Hunt and Inshorts regularly to know more about the industry.

I'm one of the core developers who can build major/critical features of the product. Parallelly expertise in handling multiple teams at the same time. Always there has been a relationship with me and Integrations from [Zarget](https://www.freshworks.com/marketing-automation/?source=fworks&medium=referral&campaign=fworks_product_nav) itself. I've built major skills and trained an AI voice assistant (Maya - similar to Amazon Alexa) in [Smartron](https://smartron.com/tronx.html).

Handled a cross-functional Expense management team from scratch and the integrations team in parallel in [Itilite](https://www.itilite.com/home). Now leading a platform team in Saama and managing the data pipeline between internal products using Kafka.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
